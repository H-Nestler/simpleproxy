Simpleproxy program acts as simple tcp proxy. It listens for local
socket, and any connection to this port will be forwarded to another
socket at remote host.

If you specify '-P <filename>' option simpleproxy will load list of
users from the <filename> (one per line). After this it will be
forwarding POP3 sessions only if client trying to authenificate as
this user.

Tested on Linux, SunOS, Solaris.
        
To install run `./configure`. Then, do 'make install'.

Can be used, for example, to run local irc client through proxy
started at ISP shell account, if some IRC serverc does not allow you
to connect directly.

Latest version always can be found at http://www.crocodile.org/software.html
